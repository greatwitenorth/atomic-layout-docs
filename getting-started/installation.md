# Installation

This tutorial will demonstrate how to use Atomic Layout in a React application. We are going to use [Create React App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/), but you can integrate it with any other React setup to your liking.

## Peer dependencies

Atomic Layout uses React for components rendering and [Styled components](https://www.styled-components.com/) to generate styles. Let's make sure these two packages are installed in our project:

```bash
$ npm install react@16.8.x styled-components@4.x
```

> You can **skip this step** if those packages are already installed in your application.

## Install

Install the latest version of Atomic Layout by running the following command in your project's root directory:

```bash
$ npm install atomic-layout
```
